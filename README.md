Fully developed a point-of-sale  (POS)  software  package  that  will  make  the  computer  function  as  a  cash  register and keep an inventory file. The inventory file will be a database of all the books in the bookstore. In general, the software is to perform the following tasks:
- Calculate the total of a sale, including sales tax
- When a book is purchased, subtract it from the inventory file
- Add, change, delete, and look up books in the inventory file
- Display various sales reports
